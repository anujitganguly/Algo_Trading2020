As we need broking license and all clearances from government to buy and sell stocks, this project is basically done to suggest the investor about when to buy a particular stock. There is no automatic buying involved in it. However if any brokerage firm, they can use this code after getting required permissions from government to help their clients.

This project is based on basic trading strategy of "Buying on Dips" i.e., buying a stock when its price falls by 5% from its 52 weeks high and buying more on each fall of 5% from last bought price. This is not any written rule but many beginner level investors follow this strategy to gain profit.

Here I have used functions and OOP concept to minimise time and give better output. After successfuly completing the main coding part with all logics, I am pplanning to add a databse so that the users don't need to worry about maintaining any records. Once completed, It will be very much helpful for beginner level investors.

File Details:
  trial_q.cpp is for basic understanding that how the code will work. It is a prototype of actual work.
