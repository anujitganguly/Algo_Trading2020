### As we need broking license and all clearances from government to buy and sell stocks, this project is basically done to suggest the investor about when to buy a particular stock. There is no automatic buying involved in it. However if any brokerage firm, they can use this code after getting required permissions from government to help their clients.

### Prerequisite:-
####  1. Understanding basics of Stock Market like Current Market Price(CMP), 52 Weeks High, 52 Weeks Low, etc.
####  2. Different market terms like Equity, Derivatives, Bull Market, Bear Market, etc.
####  3. Atleast 1 month of stck trading or 6 months of paper trading experience will be much helpful.

This project is based on basic trading strategy of "Buying on Dips" i.e., buying a stock when its price falls by 5% from its 52 weeks high and buying more on each fall of 5% from last bought price. This is not any written rule but many beginner level investors follow this strategy to gain profit.

Here I have used functions and OOP concept to minimise time and give better output. After successfuly completing the main coding part with all logics, I am pplanning to add a databse so that the users don't need to worry about maintaining any records. Once completed, It will be very much helpful for beginner level investors.

File Details:
  trial_1.cpp is for basic understanding that how the code will work. It is a prototype of actual work.
  
  
  Disclaimer: This project is mainly for helping out busy traders but rihht now it is too naive be considered as a serious tool for trading.
